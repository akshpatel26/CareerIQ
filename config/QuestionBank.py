        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "(A + B)'s rate = 1/10. C's rate = 1/50. A's rate = (B + C)'s rate. So A + B + C = 1/10 + 1/50 = 3/25. Since A = B + C, we have 2A + B = 3/25. From A + B = 1/10, we get A = 1/10 - B. Substituting: 2(1/10 - B) + B = 3/25. Solving: B = 1/25. So B alone takes 25 days."

Wait, let me recalculate: P is more than R by (195.75 - 100) = 95.75. So R is less than P by 95.75/195.75 × 100 = 48.91% ≈ 48.9%. Actually, the question asks what % R is less than P, which is (P-R)/P × 100 = 95.75/195.75 × 100 = 48.91%. Hmm, let me check options again. Actually (P-R)/R × 100 would be 95.75%.

Let me recalculate: 102:112.5 = 1020:1125 = 68:75. Simplifying: 68:75. This doesn't match options. Let me check: 102/112.5 = 0.9067. 68/75 = 0.9067. Let's see 17:18 = 0.944.

For angle of elevation 30° from top of first tower to top of second: if second tower height is h, then tan(30°) = (h-30)/60 = 1/√3. So h-30 = 60/√3 = 20√3 ≈ 34.64. Thus h = 30 + 34.64 = 64.64m.

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In non-strict mode, undeclared variables become global. In strict mode, it throws a ReferenceError."

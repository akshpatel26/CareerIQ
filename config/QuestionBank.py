    "options": ["Producer overwrites unconsumed data", "Consumer reads same data multiple times", "Both A and B", "Nothing, it works fine"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Without synchronization, race conditions can cause data corruption (producer overwriting) and data inconsistency (consumer re-reading)."

    "question": "In TCP congestion control, what is the 'slow start' algorithm?",
    "options": ["Reduces transmission speed permanently", "Exponentially increases congestion window until threshold", "Linear increase in window size", "Immediate maximum window size"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Slow start exponentially increases the congestion window size until it reaches ssthresh or packet loss occurs."

    "options": ["Encryption", "Prevent infinite routing loops", "Quality of Service", "Packet prioritization"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "TTL prevents packets from circulating indefinitely in routing loops by decrementing at each hop and discarding when it reaches 0."

  {
    "question": "In network security, what is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",
    "options": ["No difference", "Symmetric uses same key for encryption/decryption, asymmetric uses key pairs", "Asymmetric is always faster", "Symmetric is more secure"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both operations, while asymmetric uses a public-private key pair."

    "question": "What happens when TCP receives an out-of-order packet?",
    "options": ["Packet is discarded", "Packet is buffered and ACK for expected sequence number is sent", "Connection is reset", "Packet is processed immediately"],
    "correct": 1,
